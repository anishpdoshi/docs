## Device Requirements

- Minimum iOS deployment target is `16.0`.

## 1) Installation

Helium is available via Swift Package Manager under [https://github.com/cloudcaptainai/helium-swift](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Swift).

1) Install `helium-swift` into your XCode project via SPM. In XCode, you can find it under [https://github.com/cloudcaptainai/helium-swift](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Swift), or add it directly to your `Package.swift`:

```swift Package.swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(
            url: "https://github.com/cloudcaptainai/helium-swift.git",
            from: "0.1.0"
        ),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "YourTargetName",
            dependencies: [
                .product(
                    name: "Helium",
                    package: "helium-swift"
                ),
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```

## 2) Initialize Helium and fetch variants

Add the following lines somewhere in your app initialization code, typically in `AppDelegate` (or, if using SwiftUI’s `App` lifecycle, in your main ContentView’s `init()` method).

This code should be called *after* fetching remote config for Firebase.

- The Amplitude API key will be used by the SDK to forward events to Amplitude. Events will be tagged with the keyword `[Helium] <event name>`.

```swift
// In your AppDelegate
import Helium

// Initialize Helium 
Helium.initialize(
	heliumAPIKey: "<your-helium-api-key>",
	amplitudeSettings: Helium.AmplitudeAnalyticsSettings(
		amplitudeAPIKey: "<your-amplitude-api-key>",
		enableEventsLogging: true
	)
);

// Download the variant/remote paywall configs 
// for this user. Caching is to set to true.
await Helium.downloadPaywallConfig(
	cacheVariants: true) { error in
	  // handle the error
 }
```
